This lightweight plugin will help you make your website fully compatible with last EU GDPR policies.

== Description ==
Klaro is a free & open-source tool that provides an intuitive, user-friendly and compliant way to manage consent on your website. Klaro is easy to use and configure, lightweight and compatible with all modern browsers. 

Klaro is simple, unobtrusive and optimized for mobile as well as desktop browsers. It tries to stay out of the way while helping you to be fully transparent and compliant. 

Klaro can manage both inline and external scripts as well as static tracking elements like images or stylesheet links.

= Features include: =
* 100% GDPR compliant
* Customisable cookie message using .po file (multi language support)
* Redirects users to modal for more cookie information and toggle individual scripts
* Custom link to Privacy Policy page
* Option to refuse deletion of functional cookies
* Option to review and edit user consent
* Option to reset the user consent
* Set the text and background collors
* Optimised for mobile as well as desktop browsers
* Can manage: inline and external scripts, images, stylesheets, links
* Allow users to have control of what scripts are loaded.
* Shortcode to review and reset consent from privacy policy page or any post/page 

= How it Works =
To get started after install, create new Application (for internal or external scripts, images or stylesheets…) under Klaro Consent Manager / Add New. Enter script name and description, for example name it &quot;Google Analytics&quot; and enter description &quot;Google Analytics is a freemium web analytics service offered by Google&quot;. Set purpose to &quot;Analytics&quot; . Publish Application than scroll at the bottom of the newly created App and copy code generated by the plugin. Code should look something like this:
<code>
&lt;script type=&quot;opt-in&quot; data-type=&quot;application&#47;javascript&quot; data-name=&quot;google-analytics&quot;&gt;

// Your Google Analytics Code, all except script tags which we replace with this one…

&lt;&#47;script&gt; 
</code>
So in your google analytics code leave your external script as it is and change only internal script, with the code you copied above. You should get something like this:
<code>
&lt;script async src="https:&#47;&#47;www.googletagmanager.com&#47;gtag&#47;js?id=UA-XXXXXXXX-X”&gt;&lt;&#47;script&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;opt-in&quot; data-type=&quot;application&#47;javascript&quot; data-name=&quot;google-analytics&quot;&gt;

  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || &#91;&#93;;
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X’);

&lt;&#47;script&gt;
</code>
